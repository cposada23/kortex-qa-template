# Journal

Append-only session log. Each `/session-end` invocation appends a
block. Never edit history — if a past entry was wrong, append a
new entry that supersedes it.

Format per entry:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — <one-line summary>

STATE: <what's currently in flight>
DID: <what changed since last entry>
DECISIONS: <choices made>
BLOCKERS: <what's stuck and on whom>
NEXT: <what to do next session>

## 2026-05-21 13:30 — v1.2.0 completion pass

STATE: Template v1.2.0 ready for first real-client use. Three deferred playbooks promoted from stub → full (test-case-peer-review, automation-flow, version-snapshot). Five new Copilot prompts added per v1.1 plan (test-case-reviewer, automation-from-test-case, sprint-planning-intake, retro-intake, question-generator). README rewritten to reflect team-centric architecture + v1.2 scope.
DID: VERSION 1.1.0 → 1.2.0. README sync. Playbooks/{test-case-peer-review,version-snapshot,automation-flow}.md from ~40 lines stub → 150+ lines full, matching `ac-audit.md` format (Relationship to /<prompt>, When-to/What-to/How-to sections, cheat sheet, Linking output, Related). 5 new `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md` files (~150-250 lines each, ask/edit modes, mirroring existing prompt structure). INDEX rebuild.
DECISIONS: Single-client constraint stays — multi-client `clients/` zone still deferred to "post-real-usage". v1.2 closes the prompt + playbook gaps without scope creep into multi-tenancy.
BLOCKERS: none.
NEXT: First client use. Capture real friction as TODOs / patterns. Expect 2-3 patch bumps in first month addressing real-world gaps. Don't pre-emptively add features the engineer hasn't asked for.
